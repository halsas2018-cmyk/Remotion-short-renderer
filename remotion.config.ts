 * window, causing <ThreeCanvas> to time out during full video renders.
 *
 * Setting `ChromiumOpenGlRenderer = "angle"` enables the SwiftShader
 * software WebGL implementation, which is slow but works on any CPU.
 *
 * If you ever run this on a machine with a real GPU, change this to
 * `"desktop"` (or remove the call entirely) for much faster renders.

 * and upload geometry. 28s is not enough margin for a 203-cube scene on CPU.
 *
 * 2 minutes (120_000 ms) is plenty for any frame in this project.
 *
